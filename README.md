### A one-page portfolio website  

Create a one-page portfolio website. It can be for yourself, an organization, or a fictional person.  

-----------------------------------------------------------  

### Requirements Specification  

Technical Requirements:  

The page should be responsive and developed with a mobile-first approach (at least 3 different breakpoints).  

The page should be designed semantically correct.  

Use Grid, Flexbox, or a combination of both.  

Utilize relative units. Avoid hard-coded pixel values (except for media queries, box sizes, and margins/paddings).  

Include multiple images and colors (besides black and white). Indent your HTML and CSS for readability.  

Avoid the use of inline styles.  

The page should validate with the W3C validator without warnings (yellow) or errors (red) - info (green) is acceptable.  

-----------------------------------------------------------  

### Content Requirements:  
  
Your page needs to have content including:  

Page header with name/logo and menu.  

Hero section: image, headline, subheadline, and a button leading to a contact form.  

Three blocks with compelling information about yourself (or your fictional person/organization).  

Four or more blocks showcasing skills in text and image format. Some suggestions are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Fly Fishing. Come up with suitable text content (it's okay to use ChatGPT to generate text content - but not HTML/CSS for the task).  

A blog section with articles containing images and text.  

Contact form - with at least input fields for name, email, and a free-text field. The form does not need to function.  

Page footer with address and contact information, and the date of the last update to the page. Feel free to add some more fun information here.
